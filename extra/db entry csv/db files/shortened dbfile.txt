1 1/2 cups   Yogurt
1/4 cups     Milk

Method:
-------
Make a pouring paste of the besan and water.  Heat ghee and drop paste
into it through a slotted spoon to get little drops that fall one at a
time (these are boondhi).  Remove the drops when golden brown and dry on
a paper towel to remove extra oil.  Soak the drops in warm water.  Add
milk, salt, pepper, and add Chat Masala to yogurt.  Squeeze water out of
boondhi and add to yogurt.

BREADS

CHAPATI (PHULKA)
================
(for 4, serving 1 or 2)

Ingredients:
------------
1 cup     Whole wheat flour (or 1/3 white + 2/3 whole wheat)
1/2 cup   Water

Method:
-------
Put flour in a large bowl with half the water. Blend the two together until it holds.  Beat and knead well until it forms a compact ball.

Knead dough until it is smooth and elastic.  Set aside for 30 minutes.

Knead and divide dough into 4 to 6 parts.  Roll each ball into a tortilla like flat, about 1/8&Prime; thick.  Heat an ungreased skillet. 

Put phulka on it, and let it cook for about 1 minute (The top should just start to look dry and small bubbles should just start to form). 

Turn and cook the second side for 2/3 minutes until small bubbles form. 

Turn again and cook the first side pressed lightly with a towel.  It should puff.  Serve warm (maybe slightly buttered). 

Note: 
-----
Since the rolled out chappati's will dry out if they are left to stand
while cooking the others, it is advantageous to roll them out
individually before cooking them. 


PARATHA
=======

Ingredients:
------------
1 cup  Whole wheat flour
Ghee
Water 

Method:
-------
Make chappati dough.  Divide into 6 parts and make balls.  Flatten and roll each. 

Spread ghee over them and fold.  Roll again. 

Heat the paratha on a griddle like you would a chappati, but spread some ghee over the top side.  Turn and spread ghee on the other side. Fry until the bottom is crisp and golden, then turn and fry the remaining side. 

Repeat with all six. 

Serve at once, since they lose crispness if stored. 


STUFFED PARATHAS
================

Make dough for regular chappati's.

Fillings:
---------
Potato - Boil potatoes, mash, add salt and chili to taste.  Add Garam Masala and mango powder. 

Radish - Grate one large Diakon Radish, add salt and leave for 1/2 hour. Squeeze out all the water, add grated ginger, chili, and pomegranate seeds. 

Cauliflower - Grate cauliflower, add salt, pepper, garlic, and Garam Masala. 

Method:
-------
Roll out 2 small chappati's.  Place filling on one, cover with the second, seal edges and cook as for parathas.

BHEL
====

This is a concoction that I often bought from street vendors in India. 
My mouth still waters whenever I think of Bhel.  The recipe presented
here was taken off the net, and I haven't had a chance to try it yet.  I
include the note from the contributors:

Warning: 
--------
This recipe is directed at those who know what Bhelpuri tastes like,quantities mentioned are approximate, proportions are left to the
reader's taste.  Purists will have to go to an Indian grocery shop. 
Deviationists may use substitutes.  The most important thing is to keep
the puffed rice-sev mixture crisp by not adding the other ingredients to
it until it is served.  This should be done on the plate. 

Ingredients:
------------
Puffed Rice(1 carton of Rice Krispies may be used)
1 packet   Bhel mix or Sev 
2 cups     Mashed boiled potatoes (mashed coarsely and then salted)
1/2 cup    Chopped fresh coriander leaves (a.k.a Chinese parsley)
3 tsp      Freshly roasted and ground cumin 
to taste   Green chilies 
1-2 tsp    Freshly ground black pepper
to taste   Tamarind 
to taste   Jaggery (or Brown Sugar)
1 cup      Chopped onions.


Method:
-------
First boil the potatoes, mash them, salt them, and add pepper to taste. Add some coriander leaves too. 

Roast the cumin and grind it.

Dissolve about 4 Tbsp of tamarind concentrate in 1 cup of hot water, and let it simmer and thicken gradually.  Dissolve the jaggery (or sugar) until the sauce becomes tart and slightly sweet.  (You may add some salt
and ground red paprika, if you want to.) The sauce should be of a consistency slightly thinner than maple syrup.  Pour into a serving container (like a creamer).  Mix the puffed rice and sev/bhel mix in a large bowl. 

On a plate, serve the rice-bhel mixture, add the potatoes, then the onions, chilies, and then dust the cumin powder over it.  Next pour on the sauce and top with the coriander garnish. (Add salt/pepper to
taste). 

Mix the ingredients on the plate and eat.

Recipe from Sriram, 1985

This is a breakfast dish in the southern part of India.

Ingredients:
------------
1 cup        Cream of wheat 
1            Onion cut lengthwise
1 tsp        Salt 
1/4 tsp      Mustard seeds 
1/8 tsp      Urad dal
1            Cashew-nut 
1/4          Lemon 
1/2 cup      Peas 
1 clove      Garlic 
1/10&Prime; piece  Ginger
1            Green chili cut into small pieces.

Method:
-------
Fry cream of wheat on a dry pan for 5 minutes and set aside.
 
Put two tablespoons of oil in a pan and heat.  Add mustard seeds, Urad
dal, cashewnut, and garlic clove.  Wait till mustard seeds stop
splitting.  Add the onion, chili, and ginger and fry till the onion
turns brown.  Add cream of wheat and fry for 3-5 minutes.  Add salt and
peas.  Add two cups of boiling water and stir for 2 minutes.  (Switch
off the stove as soon as the water is poured.)
  
Cover the vessel for 4 minutes.  Add lime if needed. 


VEGETABLE PUFF
==============
(12 puffs)

This is a local Karnataka speciality.

Ingredients:
------------
1 Ready to use pastry roll (Pepperidge farms)
Mixed Vegetables. ( potatoes, peas may be added)
to taste  Masala
Green Chilies
to taste Salt

Method:
-------
Cook a vegetable mix with potatoes, peas, green chilies and lots of
Masala.  Check for salt, before you stuff it in the pastry roll; no way
to rectify it later. 

Thaw the roll for about 10 minutes before unfolding. 

After the pastry roll has thawed, open it out on a flat sheet and roll
it with a pin to make it a little thinner.  The pastry sheet would now
be about 12&Prime; x 12&Prime;. 

Cut the sheet into 6 pieces. 

Place about 2-3 Tbsp of the cooked vegetable onto the sheet and fold it
around it.  Seal all the corners, by pressing the sheets together and
applying a little water. 

Stick it into a pre-heated oven (350 $F^\circ$) for about 20-30 minutes
or until it browns.  Make sure that you flip it around every 5-10
minutes.

GOBI ALOO (CAULIFLOWER AND POTATOES)
====================================

This is my own recipe.

This recipe livens up ordinary cauliflower and potatoes into something
quite different.  The recipe shown here has spices that are not
necessary (like cloves and cardamom) or at least that's not how mom made
it at home, however it adds a nice touch. 

Ingredients:
------------
1            Large cauliflower 
3            Medium sized potatoes 
1/2          large  Onion  sliced thinly in long slices
1 tsp        Mustard seeds 
2 or 3 pods  Cardamom 
1 tsp        Coriander
1 tsp        Cumin seeds 
1/2 tsp      Turmeric 
1            Bayleaf 
3            Cloves 
3 tblsp      Vegetable Oil 

Method:
-------
Start boiling the potatoes in a saucepan.  Let them boil for at least 15
minutes.  After they are done, turn off the heat and let them stand in
the water. 

Cut the cauliflower into small bite sized pieces (roughly 1&Prime; cubes),
throwing away most of the stem pieces.  Wash and drain in a collander. 

While the potatoes are cooking, heat the oil in a wide skillet until it
is very hot.  Add the mustard seeds and wait until they start popping. 
Add bay leaves, cardamom and cloves. 

Mix around for a while and then add onions.  Wait until the onion starts
to turn before adding the rest of the spices (except for turmeric). 
  
Put the cauliflower in the skillet and fry in the oil and spices for 2
minutes.  While the cauliflower is frying, cut up the potatoes into bite
sized pieces and add to the skillet.  Add turmeric and stir. 
  
Continue stirring the vegetables under medium heat for another couple of
minutes.  Add 1/2 cup of water and reduce heat to low.  Cover skillet
and let cook for 5 minutes. 
  
Check tenderness of vegetables.  If they are still too hard, add another
1/4 cup of water and cover again for 5 minutes. 
  
Salt to taste and serve.



CHOLE (CHICK PEAS)
=================================
 
This recipe is named after Bill Chiles and Jim Muller both of whom liked
my concoctions well enough that I started cooking this a lot.  This is a
real simple way of making chick peas.  It barely takes 15 minutes and
the result is quite delicious.  Ask Jim and Bill. 

15 minutes

Ingredients:
------------
1 can        Chick peas (also called garbanzo beans) 
1            large Onion chopped finely
2            medium sized  Potatoes (optional)
1 tsp        Mustard seeds 
2 or 3 pods  Cardamom 
1 tsp        Coriander 
1 tsp        Cumin seeds 
1 tblsp      Garam Masala 
Vegetable Oil 

Method:
-------
If you are using the potatoes, start boiling them in a saucepan.  Let them boil for at least 15 minutes. After they are done, turn off the heat and let them stand in the water. 
  
While the potatoes are cooking, heat the oil in a wide skillet until it is very hot.  Add the mustard seeds and wait until they start popping. Add bay leaves, cardamom and cloves. 

Mix around for a while and then add onions.  Waituntill the onion starts to turn golden before adding the rest of the spices (except for the Garam Masala). 

Add chick-peas with all the liquid.  Cut up the potatoes into bite sized pieces and add to the skillet.  Add Garam Masala. 

Continue stirring the chick-peas under medium heat for 5-7 minutes without covering. 

Check the tenderness of the potatoes.  If they are still too hard, add another 1/4 cup of water and cook for another couple of minutes.

Salt to taste and serve.


MASALEDAR SEM (SPICY GREEN BEANS)
=================================
(Serves 6)

This recipe is mostly Madhur Jaffrey's, although I don't follow it to
the letter when I cook anymore.  I like to serve the beans a little
crunchier than you would find in an indian home, so I don't cook it as
much in the end.  It definitely warrants experimentation.  This recipe
is guaranteed to spice up an ordinary meal.  It also goes well with
plain rice and meat or chicken that has been prepared simply. 

Ingredients:
------------
1 1/2 lb.  Green beans (Trim the ends and then cut the beans in half 
           crosswise.)
1 1/2&Prime;     long and Fresh ginger (Peel and chop coarsely.) 1&Prime; thick piece 
10 cloves  Garlic peeled
1 cup      Water
4 tblsp    Vegetable oil
3 tsp      Whole cumin seeds
2 tsp      Ground coriander seeds
2          medium Tomatoes, peeled (put tomatoes in very hot water for a 
           few seconds, peel off the skin and finely chop.)
to taste   Salt 
Freshly ground pepper
3 tblsp    Lemon juice (or to taste)

Method:
-------
Put ginger and garlic into a food processor and add 1/2 cup water. 
Blend until fairly smooth. 
  
Heat the oil in a wide, heavy saucepan over a medium flame.  When hot,
put in the cumin seeds.  Stir for half a minute.  Pour in the
ginger-garlic paste.  Stir and cook for about two minutes.  Put in the
coriander and stir a few times. 
  
Put in the chopped tomatoes.  Stir and cook for 2 minutes while mashing
the tomato pieces with the back of a slotted spoon.  Put in the beans
and salt and one cup of water and simmer them.  Cover, turn heat to low
and cook for 8-10 minutes or until the beans are tender. 
  
Remove the cover.  Add the lemon juice and a generous amount of freshly
ground pepper. 
  
Turn up the heat and boil away the remaining liquid, stirring the beans
gently as you do so.

1/4-1/2 tsp   Coriander powder

another 4-5 minutes).  Add the garlic and ginger paste (preferably
prepared from fresh ginger and garlic).  Add dhania powder and chili
powder (if green chili was not added before).  Add the tomato paste and
one cup of water (you have to experiment with the quantity of water

cup of coconut flakes. 
 
Reduce the flame and cover the vessel.  After about 4 minutes, stir the

CHICKEN CURRY NORTH INDIAN STYLE
================================

My own, mostly from mom's but synthesized with recipes from other
friends. 

Ingredients:
------------
1 lb        Chicken-drumsticks, thighs, breast pieces
1           small carton  Plain yogurt
2           medium Onions very finely chopped
4 tbsp       Vegetable oil
2           Cloves
1/2 tsp     Mustard powder
2 pods      Cardamom
1/2 tsp     Cumin powder
1 tsp       Garam Masala
1 tsp       Chili Powder
1/2&Prime; piece  Ginger 
4 cloves    Garlic 
1/3 tsp     Coriander Seeds 
to taste    Salt 
1/2 tsp     Freshly ground pepper 

Method:
-------
Remove fat from the chicken and then salt and pepper it.  Sprinkle with
chili powder.  Add yogurt and mix well until the chicken is covered
liberally with yogurt.  Use your hands.  Set aside for 1 hour before
cooking.  If kept in the refrigerator, set aside for at least 4 hours. 
  
Heat oil in a large heavy pan.  When oil is hot, add mustard seeds, if
you are using them.  Add cloves, cardamom, and coriander seeds and fry
for 30 seconds.  Add the onion and fry for two minutes until the onion
beings to turn brown.  Lower heat to medium.  Add the ginger and garlic
paste and fry for 4-6 minutes.  Add mustard powder, if using it, add
Garam Masala, and add cumin powder. 
  
Brush excess yogurt off the chicken and put it in a large pot.  Add
ingredients from the frying pan.  Cook uncovered over high heat for 4
minutes.  Reduce heat to low and cover.  Cook for 25 minutes or until
the chicken is tender, stirring every 5 minutes. 

Important note: 
---------------
When chicken is cooked with a cover on the pot, it releases water that
becomes a part of the sauce.  If after 10 minutes, there isn't enough
sauce in the pot, add 1/4 cup water.  Conversely, if there is too much
liquid in the pot, cook uncovered until the liquid evaporates. 

Variations: 
-----------
There are several variations to the above recipe:

1.) Leave out the yogurt.  Add 1/4 cup of water just before turning the
heat to low and covering the pot. 
  
2.) Boil two potatoes for 10 minutes before slicing them thinly.  Add
sliced potatoes to the pot when you start cooking the chicken. 
  
3.) This variation is usually called &Prime;Malai Chicken&Prime; or literally
&Prime;creamy&Prime; chicken.  Leave out the yogurt.  When the chicken is 3/4 done,
add one small can of tomato paste.  Just before removing add a small
carton of whipping cream, and cook for a few minutes. 


CHICKEN CURRY (MURGA)
=====================     
(4-6 Servings)

Ingredients:
------------
2-2 1/2 lb   Skinned chicken
1 tbsp          Garam Masala
3 tbsp          Salt
1 cup          Finely chopped tomato
1/4 cup        Vegetable oil
1/2 cup        Water
1 1/2 cups      Finely chopped onion
1 1/2 tbsp      Fresh ginger, chopped
1 tbsp          Finely chopped garlic
1 tbsp          Vinegar
1            Dried chili (optional)

Method:
-------
Cut chicken, separate legs and thighs, back and split breast.  Heat oil
over high heat.  Add onions and fry until golden brown.  Take care not
to burn them.  Add garlic, ginger and tomatoes.  Fry until a smooth
paste is obtained.  Add chicken, add water, bring to a boil, and add
salt.  Cover pot and lower heat.  Add chili to make it hot if desired. 
Stir constantly to avoid burning and coat the chicken pieces evenly. 

After the chicken is done, add vinegar and cook for another 5 minutes on
very low heat.  Sprinkle on Garam Masala and serve. 


TANDOORI CHICKEN
================
(2-3 Servings)

Ingredients:
------------
6 pieces    Thawed chicken, skinned
2 tsp       Ground Coriander
2 tsp       Masala (Tandoori paste is available)
to taste    Red pepper powder
Dash        Garlic powder
to taste    Salt
1 tsp       Ground jeera
Soy sauce (or yogurt)
(needed only if tandoori masala is used)

Method:
-------
If you are using the ready made tandoori paste then life is a lot
easier.  Replace all occurences of masala and soy sauce (or yogurt) with
the tandoori paste. 

Take the chicken and make *deep* cuts in it (so that the Masalas seeps
in quickly).  If you are using soy sauce as the base, put some on the
chicken pieces and let it seep in the cuts. 

Rub in the Masalas as a mixture or one at a time.  The idea is to let
the Masalas seep in the cuts with the soy sauce.  You can leave it for
little while to seep in. 

If you are using yogurt, you'll get a more authentic taste since the
original TC is after all marinated in it.  In this case, mix the Masalas
in the yogurt first and then rub the stuff into the chicken cuts as
before.  The yogurt tends to leave a considerable amount of water
behind.  DON'T THROW THIS AWAY.  Let it evaporate in the oven with the
chicken.  This will keep the pieces from getting dry if over-cooked.  I
have not faced the same problem with the soy sauce version (of dry
chicken). 

Cook the chicken until it starts turning brown.  and the cuts you made
start &Prime;expanding.&Prime;
 
Notes:
------
You may use any other interesting sauce as the base.  Some previous
experiences of my own are: Teriyaki (my Japaani-tandoori), Oriental
sauce (my supermarket-tandoori).

LAMB AND BEEF
=============

LAMB VINDALOO
=============

&gt;From Esquire Magazine, 1986: 

I have made the recipe a couple of times and both times with very good
results.  The finished dish is a spicy lamb dish that is quite
exquisite.  Be warned that this recipe takes quite a bit of effort to
put together. 

Ingredients:
------------
3 lbs   Lean boneless lamb
3       Meaty lamb bones

Marinade made from:
-------------------
4 tblsp    Light vegetable oil
1/4 cup      Cider vinegar
3 tblsp    Tamarind pulp
to taste   Salt

Puree made from:
----------------
2 tblsp    Vegetable oil
1          large White onion
6          Garlic cloves
2 tblsp    Fresh ginger root, chopped
1/2 cup      Vegetable oil
3 cups        Onion, thinly sliced
1 tsp      Ground cumin
1 tsp      Ground mustard
3 tsp      Turmeric
1 1/2 tsp  Red pepper
3 tsp      Paprika
2 1/2 cups    Hot water

Method:
-------
Cut lamb into 3/4 &Prime; cubes.
  
Place lamb and the bones in a non-metallic bowl with the four
tablespoons of oil, the vinegar, tamarind pulp, and salt.  Let it
marinate at room temperature for eight hours or, refrigerated, for 24
hours. 
  
Put two tablespoons of oil, the onion, garlic, and ginger in an electric
blender or food processor and run the machine until a fine pasty puree
is formed. 
  
Heat the one-half cup of vegetable oil in a large enamel coated skillet
over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and saute until they are caramel
brown, stirring constantly to prevent burning. 
  
Add the puree.  Reduce the heat and add ground cumin, ground mustard,
turmeric, red pepper, and paprika.  When the spices begin to sizzle and
turn dark, in about 15 seconds, add the lamb and bones.  Cook until
slightly seared (about ten minutes). 
  
Add the water and bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer,
partially covered, until the meat is very tender (about thirty minutes). 
Pick out and discard bones.  Serve over rice.

DESSERTS AND OTHER GOODIES
==========================

KHEER (VERMICELLI PUDDING)
==========================

Recipe from Dalbir Chadda: 

This has been my all time favorite dessert.  Ever since I was very
little, I can remember asking for seconds and thirds.  What makes this
dessert unusual is that it is not as sweet as most Indian desserts.  It
is fairly simple to make.  Make sure that the vermicelli is very fine
(angel hair pasta is ok but the very fine vermicelli that can be bought
at chinese stores is the best). 

Ingredients:
------------
1 stick      Butter
2 handfuls   Very fine vermicelli
4 cups       Milk
1 pint       Whipping cream
1 handful    Raisins
3 tblsp      Sugar
4            Almonds (optional) peeled and thinly sliced

Method:
-------
Melt butter in a 4 qt pot.  Break vermicelli into 3&Prime; pieces.  Over low
heat stir vermicelli into butter until it turns light brown.  Pour in
the milk and stir over medium heat until it boils.  Put in the raisins,
almonds and sugar. 
  
Continue to cook under low heat for 10 minutes.  Add whipping cream and
continue to cook for a couple of minutes.  Remove from heat and, when
cool, chill in the refrigerator before serving


RICE FLOUR PUDDING
================== 
(6 servings)

Ingredients:
------------
4 1/2 cups    Milk
3/4 cup      Sugar
2 oz       Rice flour
6-8 drops  Rose water
1 oz       Almonds
1/2 oz     Pistachio nuts

Method:
-------
Blanch (optional) and shred nuts.  Mix rice flour into the milk and mix
until smooth.  Cook over medium heat until a creamy consistency is
achieved (20-30 minutes?).  Simmer and add sugar and stir for 2-3
minutes more. 

Cool (in refrigerator for 30 minute) add the rose water, almonds and
pistachios (maybe before it cools).  Pour into individual dishes and
serve. 


BESAN BURFI
===========

Ingredients:
------------
1 cup       Besan
1 cup       Shortening
1 cup       Sugar
4 seeds   Cardamom
Nuts (optional)

Method:
-------
Melt shortening in a pan.  Turn down heat and add cardamom and Besan. 
Fry, stirring constantly to prevent burning until it has changed to a
brown color and smells done.  (Test: a few drops of water sprinkled on
it sputters instantly). 

Turn off the heat and stir in the sugar.  Spread 1/2&Prime; thick onto a
platter.  Cut into diamond shapes after it has cooled down. 


KHEER

1/2 cup      Rice

1/4 cup      Shredded blanched almonds
6-8 drops  Rose water
1/2 cup      Water 

Method:
-------
Wash and drain the rice.  Soak in 1/2 cup water for 1/2 hour.  Boil the
rice in the same water until it is coated and the water dries up.  Add
the milk and simmer on low heat for 1 1/2 hours. 

Scrape the sides and bottom frequently to prevent sticking and mash rice
while stirring.  When it is creamy, add sugar and stir in well.  Remove
from heat and add crushed cardamom seeds, rose water and shredded
almonds. 

Serve hot or cold decorated with silver leaves (optional).  [Silver
leaves are VERY FINE, tasteless sheets of silver.]

CARROT HALVA

2 cups       Sugar
2 cups       Carnation milk powder
1 cup       Oil
to taste  Nuts

burning (3 to 4 hours).  Add oil and cook more, stirring often, to roast
the carrots well (about 1/2 hour).  Add the powdered milk and sugar and

sides.  Add the nuts and raisins and turn off the heat.  Pour in a
serving dish and serve warm or cold.  Will keep in the refrigerator for

RASGOOLA
========

Ingredients:
------------
1 ltr     Homogenized Milk 
2 tsp     White Vinegar
1 1/2 cups   Sugar
3 cups       Water

Method:
-------
Bring the milk to a boil and add vinegar to the boiling milk to separate
the whey.  Throw away the liquid part by sifting the stuff onto a muslin
cloth.  Pour some cold water over the curd to cool and wash it.  Discard
the water and hang the cloth for 15-20 minutes to let the excess water
drip off. 

Put the curd in a food processor or blender and blend at high speed to
get a smooth consistency.  You may add just a little (1 tsp or so) water
while blending, if the curd is too dry and will not blend.  Be very
careful so as not to add any extra water.  Remove the paste and make
small balls (1-2&Prime; in diameter). 

Boil water in a wide vessel.  Make sure that there is at least 2-3&Prime; of
water in the vessel.  If not, add more water and increase the quantity
of sugar proportionately.  Add sugar to the boiling water to make a
light syrup. 

Continue boiling the syrup and gently drop the curd balls in the boiling
syrup.  Cook the balls in the boiling syrup for 30-40 minutes.  Remove
from the heat and let the stuff cool down.  Put the balls and the syrup
in a storage container and refrigerate (don't freeze).  Serve cold. 


MANGO ICE CREAM
===============

This is a great desert which can be made with very little effort.  You
can replace the Mango pulp with any other pureed fruit. 

Ingredients:
------------
1 can    Condensed Milk
12 oz.   Whipped cream(Cool whip)
1 can    Mango pulp (Alphonso)

It is very confusing to describe quantities as 1 can.  Well, I do not
remember the exact numbers so let me describe the sizes.  The Mango pulp
can is about 6&Prime; high and 3&Prime; in diameter. I think it is the only size
available in an Indian store.  The condensed milk can is about 3&Prime; high
and about 2.5&Prime; in diameter and should be available in your neighbourhood
grocery store. 

Method:
-------
Mix all of the pulp, condensed milk and whipped cream in a bowl.  Put in
the freezer for about 8 hours.
